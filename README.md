CodeForces solved problems

This directory contains accepted solutions of problems found at https://codeforces.com/problemset

NOTE : 
1) This directory will be updated with solutions of challenges only after they end for everyone(more info 
on this can be found at codeforces site)
2) All the solutions are compiled on Visual Studio 2019 which uses gnu c++ 17 version 7.3.0
3) Each directory contains a *"problem.txt"* file that contains the problem description and *".cpp"* file that contains the solution code
4) Some of the solutions provided here belong to *"Penalty Problems"*, i.e., submitting wrong answers will cost you a penalty of >=50 points, so be absolutely sure before submitting a solution
5) Solutions are available for help purposes only, copying and pasting the accepted code is not a good practice for any programmer
